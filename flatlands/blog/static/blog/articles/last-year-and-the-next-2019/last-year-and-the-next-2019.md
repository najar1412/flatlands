With 2018 come and gone ive had time to think about my personal progress in all things development.

Tooling and web development had been the bulk of my interest moving into and during 2018. 
The tooling involved plugins and scripts for 3d content creation applications, desktop GUIs using qt and command line applications that offered features like user access to our cloud providers and overviews of project folder structures.

In terms of web development i'd put together dashboards that would scan a local network with tools to monitor, load and terminate processes on the various machines found. 
Asset management and documentation were also a large part of my 2018. 
Web applications that multiple users could colaborate on to produce office-entric documention and a computer vision backed asset library, feeding in an image of the asset returned a list of objects detected within the image and used as search criteria.

thats a big spread, which 90% of it was done using Python.

2019 for me feels like it'll be quite similar to my 2018.
Moving around the frontend and backend web space, 3rd party software extension/scripting and cloud integration.

Im in a unique position to also bring together two of my loves. that is software dev and 3d content.
I've had some time both professionally and personally to dive into webgl and the various frameworks available for handling 3d in the browser.


i'd like to spend more time in the realm of 3d on the web. 
id like to gain a deeper understanding of the VR.
