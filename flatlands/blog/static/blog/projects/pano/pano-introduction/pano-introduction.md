_Pano is an interactive panorama manager. The app is aimed at 3d/visualization professionals, but great care is being taken to allow anyone to use it._

### current panorama software

There are a couple of different ways to do interactive panoramas. Pano is focused on the traditional technique or somehow getting a 360 degree image (whether via photography or 3d rendering), projecting it onto a sphere and placing a camera at the spheres center for the user to use to move around.

The current generation of panoramas sit on the boundaries of the uncanny valley. They look good, they just they don't look *correct*.

One of the biggest culprits is [parallax](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax). Parallax is the perceived change in position of an object seen from two different places. This phenomenon is the only real way for the user to judge distances within an image. 

You can see this in everyday life too, just stand at the top of a long street and look towards the other end. Take a couple of steps to the left or right. 
Can you see objects getting occluded or revealing themselves from behind foreground objects? That's Parallax.

Common optical problems are also left out of standard panorama software these may seem like problems, but to the average eye _not_ seeing these things will affect the realism. Things like chromatic aberration, lens distortion and glare.
