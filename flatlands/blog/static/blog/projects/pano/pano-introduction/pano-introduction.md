_Pano is an interactive panorama manager._

### What?

Pano allows the user to create, manage and share interactive 360 virtual tours from panorama images in the browser.

### Why Pano over [insert other software]?

The current generation of panoramas sit on the boundaries of the uncanny valley. They look good, they just they don't look *correct*.

Pano aims to produce the most immersive experience possible. To do this there are some real world phenomenon that need to be reacreated that currently arent available in other panorama software.

One of the biggest culprits is [parallax](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax). _Parallax is the perceived change in position of an object seen from two different

In the 3d rendering world imperfection is what makes realism. Having a surface that's super clean without the dirt and grime, without the knocks and dings of everyday life is what makes the surface look fake. It's these imperfections that'll need to be implemented to take interactive panoramas to the next level.
