_I've worked with alot of digital artists and one of the best ways they can get freelance work or just to show off their imagery to the world is to have a website. There's many different platforms that make this a somewhat simple process using website builders etc. Still, a few people have mentioned ‘it's a hassle’ and ‘who wants to spend the evening setting up a site that's really just going to be used as an image dump’._

_I have first hand knowledge of the time and effort required to produce cgi images and film as well as the nerve wracking experience it can be to present such work to the client who’ll potentially be investing thousands of pounds into a single image._

_Armed with this knowledge i thought it’d be a great experience to build a web app thats super simple to use and manage with the ultimate goal of presenting great images, using a clean and attractive layout._
