 > A minimalist gallery thats all about the visual content.

It's always a pain to put together a select collection of imagery. That shouldn't be made worse by having then to figure out a way to present it online. Portfo aimes to be a quick and simple solution to that problem. A image dump of sorts, using a selection of *gallery style* templates for presentation. 

Creating **multiple galleries** from holiday snaps means Mum sees the beach and the lads/ladies see the beers/beers!

All those kitten gifs can be dropped into a gallery and **password protected if needed**  so only you and the partner can geekface over them.

**Customizable branding** ensures the next employer knows the name and contact details of someone if they ever need [smoke roto'ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEkuHBpvJw0).
