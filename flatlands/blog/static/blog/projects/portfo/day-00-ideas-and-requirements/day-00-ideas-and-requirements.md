I work with alot of digital artists and one of the best ways they get work or just like to show off work to the world is to have a website. There's many different sites that make this a simple process using website builders etc. Still, a few people have mentioned it's still a hassle and who wants to spend the evening setting up a site that's really just going to be used as an image dump.

I spent a fair few years producing cgi for print and film. So i’m in a unique position to understand the needs of the client - which in this case are digital artists. I have intimate knowledge of the time and effort required produce images and film as well as the nerve wracking experience it can be to present such work to the client who’ll potentially be investing thousands of pounds into a single image.

Before i start a project i’ll usually sit down with the people that would potentially use the software and try to get an idea of what they need. Notice there i said ‘need’. A lot of clients ‘want’ the world, this of course isn't possible. It becomes quite a mission to pull out the needs of a client over the wants.

I had a long weekend to myself while my girlfriend was off doing girlfriend things. so i figured i’d have a think about possible requirements of a super simple system that allowed the uploading and presentation of images.

* They’ll need to be minimal steps required to upload and present images.
* a simple clean ui that is all about the work.
* a way for potential clients to contact the artist.
* some form of backend ui to manage the images.

All in all a pretty basic crud app. Most apps i build for work won't ever be seen by more than ~60 people, so i don't usually spend a whole lot of time on the frontend. The industry i work in is very fast moving and does not allow much time in building solutions. So for this project i decided to dip my toes in the javascript waters. When i say dip i literally mean graze the surface.

My typical stack consists of python/flask, postgres, html/css. I don't see any reason to change that up. So i’ll move forward using that with a sprinkle of javascript.
